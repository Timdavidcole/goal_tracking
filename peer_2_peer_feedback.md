__Pairing session feedback__

25/06 Harry: _Said I had strong desire to understand concepts, not just complete exercises_. He did a good job of making sure we didn't get bogged down.

26/06 James: _Pleased I didn't want to work into the night_.  Strong methodological approach.

27/06 Dan: _I was able to not be impatient with material I'd already worked on.  Needed to pay attention to my TABing/Double spacing._ Dan managed to adapt well to my more chaotic and egalitarian pairing approach.
