# Readme

This repository functions as self-reflective learning resource to check I'm setting and achieving my own goals.  But also to check my own syllabus aligns with Maker's goals.
Each goal with follow a similar process to track it's progress.

- Learning Objective - S.M.A.R.T goals.  Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time-bound.

- Evidence: How will I know I achieved it?

- Validate: How will I know how well I did?

- Learning resources and strategies: What resources and methods wil help me achieve the objective?

- Proof of completion: Links to completed work

## General goals

- Use tools to track learning
- TDD right away
- Don't stress about completion, learning objections are more important than projects.
- Communicate with peers, make you ask for feedback and keep it.
- Pace yourself; take breaks; time-box your weekend; no more than 1 hour an evening
- Use the coaches, don't be afraid to ask.
- Rely on your cohort.
